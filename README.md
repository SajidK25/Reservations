The **Reservations Management System** is a simple yet robust RESTful API designed to handle user registration, authentication, and the comprehensive management of users, appointments, and reservations. The system is built using modern technologies such as NestJS and TypeScript, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. PostgreSQL is used for reliable and efficient data storage, while Docker is leveraged for streamlined deployment and scalability across different environments.

###Origin as a College Project
This project originated as a college assignment, where the primary objective was to address real-world challenges in managing reservations and user data efficiently. The initial phase focused on understanding the requirements typical for reservation systems—such as user authentication, appointment scheduling, and secure data handling—which are common in industries like hospitality, healthcare, and education. The academic setting provided a foundation for applying software engineering principles, collaborative development, and iterative improvement, ensuring the system would be both practical and educational.

###Current Development Status
The Reservations Management System is currently under active development
